# Steam_Acc_Switcher


Steam Account Switcher coded using Python. It is able to read and write from text files in order to store account login details as well as automatically input details to the steam login form all through the GUI. It is a work in progress and I may add encryption at some point to protect account credentials. The main purpose of this project was to learn various modules, so areas of code may be slightly inefficient or basic.
